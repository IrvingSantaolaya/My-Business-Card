# My-Business-Card
Share your business card infromation through a QR Code!

## What the app does
You can enter basic contact information into the app. 
The app then turns the information into a V-Card (contact card), then it transforms the V-Card into a QR Code image.
Most smartphones have a built in QR Code scanner built into the camera, so all someone has to do is scan your QR Code and they will be prompted to save your contact info to their phone.
Without having to type anything in!
